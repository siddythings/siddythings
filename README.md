### 👋 Welcome to my dev corner on the Internet!  
![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=siddythings.siddythings&style=flat-square&color=blue)

I'm a founder-focused engineer, currently building products at the intersection of AI, automation, and the creator economy. Over the years, I’ve launched multiple SaaS tools, marketplaces, and full-stack systems—shipping fast and iterating with user feedback.

### ⚙️ What I'm Building:

- 🛍️ [Nippy](https://try-nippy.com) — Nippy is your AI-powered action agent that turns natural language into real-world tasks. Instead of switching between 10 different apps to get one thing done, users can simply tell Nippy what they want — like “schedule a call, send an intro email, and prep a doc” — and Nippy handles it across tools like Gmail, Notion, and Calendar.

### ⚙️ What I've build previously:
- 🧬 [HealthVital](https://healthvital.app) — A healthtech platform that helps you easily understand your health reports. Chat with your report to get deep insights, ask questions, and get personalized recommendations on diet, exercise, and more..
- ⚡ [1kwh.in](https://1kwh.in) — India’s first P2P renewable energy trading platform, built on blockchain + AI.

### 👨‍💻 A Bit More About Me
- 🛠 Backend wizardry in Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis, Celery, AWS, GCP and many more.
- 🧪 Tinkering with LLMs, embeddings, LangChain, fine-tuning, and vector databases.
- 🌍 Previously launched apps across 18+ countries, scaled features across healthtech, energy, and automotive domains.

### 💡 What I Enjoy:

- ✍️ Writing about problems I’ve solved (and the ones that made me cry first).
- 🧵 Building in public. Shipping MVPs fast. Breaking things to learn faster.
- 🧠 Anything to do with automation, marketplaces, AI, and indie hacking.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaborating with founders & creators to build bold things.
